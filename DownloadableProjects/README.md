###MPLAB Harmony
MPLAB Harmony is a flexible, abstracted, fully integrated firmware development platform for PIC32 microcontrollers. It takes key elements of modular and object oriented design, adds in the flexibility to use a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) or work without one, and provides a framework of software modules that are easy to use, configurable for your specific needs, and that work together in complete harmony.

MPLAB Harmony includes a set of peripheral libraries, drivers and system services that are readily accessible for application development. The code development format allows for maximum re-use and reduces time to market.
